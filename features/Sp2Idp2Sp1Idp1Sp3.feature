Feature: Ensure I can login to Sp2 through Idp2, must login to Sp1 if I choose Idp1, and don't need to login for Sp3.

  Scenario: Login to SP2 through IDP2
    When I go to the SP2 login page
     And I should see "Enter your username and password"
     And I login using password "b"
    Then I should see "test_admin@idp2.org"

  Scenario: Login to SP1 through IDP1
    When I go to the SP1 login page
     And the url should match "sildisco/disco.php"
     And I click on the "IdP 1" tile
     And I should see "Enter your username and password"
     And I login using password "a"
    Then I should see "test_admin@idp1.org"

  Scenario: After IDP2 login, go directly to SP3 without credentials
    Given I have authenticated with IDP1 for SP1
     And I go to the SP3 login page
     And the url should match "sildisco/disco.php"
     And I should see "to continue to SP3"
    Then I click on the "IdP 1" tile
